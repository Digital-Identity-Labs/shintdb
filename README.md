# shintdb

PostgreSQL Docker Container with support for multiple databases, for integration testing

Uses the official Postgresql image (Alpine version) plus https://github.com/mrts/docker-postgresql-multiple-databases

We use this for integration testing a group of backend services running in Docker containers - having one database container per service seems excessive.

Not supported by us in any way: shared as a public repo just in case it might be useful.
